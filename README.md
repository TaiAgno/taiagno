# ðŸ’« well hello, Tai here!

reporting from Queenstown, New Zealand.

before the whole blurb starts, I just need to say:<br>I'm about to start working on a gamification project - VERY EXCITED!


life has been a roller coaster, for good and bad.<br>
what do you do with the bad?<br>
take it, smash it, turn it into good.<br>

any coder out there knowsâ€”there is no day like the other.<br>foreseen and unforeseen challenges are the norm.<br>for me, that is gold; nothing motivates me more than a shiny challenge.

do you have a challenge for me?

<br>
<br>

I achieved a Master's Degree in History when I was 22 years old - specifically History of Photography.<br>
during my academic years I also studied formal photography, including darkroom development. I still have a full darkroom set up in my parents home.

diverting from that path, my first work experience was in Show Business, negotiating contracts and planning tours for, mainly, international artists and companies.

eventually it made sense to pursue a better life in New Zealand, and I made the move in 2015.<br>
as an immigrant, I found work in Hospitality and dutifully performed various rolesâ€”from Reservations Assistant to Front Office Supervisor in Auckland, and later as Duty Manager and Reservationist in Queenstown.

for over a year now, I have been able to pursue my true calling in development.<br>in this journey, I achieved a Diploma in Web Development and Web Design, and most recently, I completed a Cloud & DevOps Software Development program.
